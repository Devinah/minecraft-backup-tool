## Things I'd like to do ##

  * Redesign the settings page to allow more settings (e.g. use a tree or a list to switch between multiple panels -- <a href='mailto:mark@indigorose.com'>Mark</a> suggested using a master page for the selector and sub pages for the panels, good idea!)
  * Add the RestoreListSortOrder setting to the gui
  * Add an option to limit the number of backups saved per world

## Things I might do ##

  * Add a way to restore a backup from an arbitrary path. To keep the gui clean I'm thinking of inserting a special item in the list, e.g. select that if you want to browse for a backup file, or I might add a "Browse" link instead.
  * Provide some mechanism for backing up arbitrary world paths e.g. not in %AppData%
  * Add an option to prevent files with comments from being deleted when limiting the number of backups saved per world
  * Extract information about the maps stored in the backup files and display that in the gui (e.g. player coordinates)

## Stuff I haven't thought of yet ##

  * You tell me! :)
